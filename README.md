# CodeAcademy_Final_markov
This repository contains my final project for the  Code Academy python course.
This program creates a new song with lyrics in the style of your n favorite artist(s).
It prompts you to enter n number of urls(for the number of songs you want to mix) from the website wwww.azlyrics.com,
it then uses a Markov Chain algorithim to mix up the text from the two files. Finally the result is formatted 
to look like new written lyrics.
